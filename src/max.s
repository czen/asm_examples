		#PURPOSE: This program finds the maximum number of a
		# set of data items.
		#
		#VARIABLES: The registers have the following uses:
		# %rdx - Holds the index of the data item being examined
		# %rdi - Largest data item found
		# %rax - Current data item
		#
		# The following memory locations are used:
		# data_items - contains the item data. A 0 is used
		# to terminate the data
		.section .data
		
data_items: #These are the data items
		.quad 3,67,34,222,45,75,54,34,44,33,22,11,66,0
		.section .text
		.globl _start
_start:
		movq $0, %rdx # move 0 into the index register
		movq data_items(,%rdx,8), %rax # load the first byte of data
		#Start at address data_items, add 8 * value of RDI to that
		#address, and finally load the memory content of this address into
		#the register RAX
		movq %rax, %rdi # since this is the first item, %rax is
		# the biggest
start_loop: # start loop
		cmpq $0, %rax # check to see if we've hit the
		# end
		je loop_exit
		incq %rdx # load next value
		movq data_items(,%rdx,8), %rax
		cmpq %rdi, %rax # compare values
		jle start_loop # jump to loop beginning if the
		#new
		# one isn't bigger
		movq %rax, %rdi # move the value as the largest
		jmp start_loop # jump to loop beginning
loop_exit:
		# %rdi is the status code for the exit system call
		# and it already contains the maximum number
		movq $60, %rax # 60 is the exit() syscall
